    <p><strong> Have you ever wondered what drives a passionate coder through the modern world of Computer Science?
            Welcome, my name is Maahi Madhavan, a dedicated coder currently a student at Dublin High School. Let me
            tell you a little about myself. Read below to find out!</strong></p>
    <h2>My Personal Career Goals</h2>
    <p><strong> As a high school student,
            I have already realized that my academic journey is tied to the world of Computer Scienceâ€”a realization that
            I made during the
            initial semester of my freshman year. Guided by my childhood mentor, my father, I am on a path to excel in a
            field that not only aligns with my
            comfort but also brings me immense satisfaction. To achieve my goal of pursuing Computer Science, I plan to
            take coding courses over the summer to excel my knowledge, so that I can
            get farther in my career. Expanding on my career objectives, one of my treasured hobbies that I love is
            playing cricket,
            a passion I grasped at an early age. I aspire to make the USA women's cricket team and play professionally.
            While cricket is
            a sport dominated by boys, I try to stand out from the boys and show everyone why I'm different from the
            other girls on the field.
            To achieve this goal, I want to practice everyday and stay consistent during my training to receive the best
            results in my games. </p>

    <h2>Personal Qualities and Achievement</h2>
    <p><strong> A few skills and strengths that I exhibit, are my ability to be decisive, problem-solve, and also to be
            innovative. Obstacles or challenging problems allow me to think out of the box and look at the roadblock in a
            different perspective to find the root of the problem. As of this year, I have taken the initiative to join
            the Young Innovators Club at DHS, this club volunteers at different elementary schools and does community
            service. Additionally, I have experience volunteering at my cricket association, SRCA, where I would guide
            younger athletes in their journey to competitive cricket. My experiences have led me to figure out that I am
            fond of working out challenging problems and conscientious when it comes to completing a task. </strong></p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p><strong> All in all, I am determined to follow the route of computer science for my career as well as maintaining
            a consistent routine and practice for my future as a cricket player. My expertise in problem-solving and
            being creative enables me to approach the problem with a different perspective. Thank you for reading about
            me and hope you found it enjoyable! </strong></p>
